# launch-extension
Custom Launch Extension for data elements

Instructions to set this in the local environment:

- Clone this repository to your local system. Use any IDE or editor to view and execute the project. I used Eclipse IDE.

- On the terminal, go to the project root folder, execute the following commands to run it on the sandbox environment.

        -  <project folder path> npm init
        
        -  <project folder path> npx @adobe/reactor-sandbox
        
 - Extension sandbox will run at http://localhost:3000 and at https://localhost:4000
 
 - Open the sandbox using the localhost URL
